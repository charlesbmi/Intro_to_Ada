# Intro_to_Ada
A collection of introductory Ada examples.

To run an example, execute `gnatmake example.adb`, then run the resulting binary.

Suggested order:
1. hello\_world.adb - first Ada program
2. prime.adb - control structure syntax
3. lunch.adb - enumeration types, subtypes, and arrays
4. bad\_lunch.adb - run-time constraint errors, exception handler syntax
5. access\_types.adb - access types (pointers), records (structs), and dynamic memory allocation / deallocation. Example adapted from Ada Crash Course
6. conditions.adb - pre-conditions and post-conditions
7. tasking.adb - Simple concurrency.
